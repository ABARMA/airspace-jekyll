## Why are communities important?

A lot of us are in awe of the idea of bootstrapping and hustling our way to success. However, historical experiences of succesful creators demonstrate the importance of the roles played by their community of mentors, friends and family, who not only supported them but also encouraged them to stay motivated and taste the success they had set out to achieve. 
The road to success is a long one. While we're confident and enjoy the small wins in the earlier weeks/months, maintaining the momentum to stay persistent can be tough for many of us. These are the moments where one may need a community more than ever.<br/>Finding and being part of the right community, however, plays a crucial role in deriving the benefits from it. Here, we are trying to build a community of digital content creators, who are growing in large numbers, and may need help along the journey. The reason we thought of doing so is because of the benefits offered by a community of like-minded individuals. Let us look at some of these below. 

## Top 5 benefits of a Community
<br/>
<h4> <b><i> 1. Learning Opportunity </i></b></h4>

Being part of a community of individuals working in or passionate about the same things increases the likelihood of meeting mentors. In case you are just starting out, this could mean getting advice on the right areas to focus on, right tools to use, and proven tactics to consider, which in turn could increase your chance of achieving success. If you've been in the game for a while, this could be a chance to receive guidance on corrective measures and get exposure to more opportunities that you might have missed. Having a mentor can be the key differentiating factor between success and failure, primarily because one can learn from others and avoid costly mistakes in one's journey.

<h4><b><i> 2. Building Networks </i></b></h4> 

Joining a community gives you a chance to grow your professional and personal network. With access to digital communities, you can connect with influencers from across the world and become more known. The benefit that you could get from this is in the form of recommendations that can help you gain a competitive advantage by making you more trustworthy amongst your target customers. This works particularly well for B2B firms.

<h4><b><i> 3. Accessing inspirational resources </i></b></h4>  

Content creators start strong with interesting ideas that help them ride the wave initially. More often than not, sustaining this becomes difficult. The rich exchange of ideas, opinions and knowledge amongst the community members can help with continuity in creative-thinking and overcoming of potential roadblocks. We have always heard of how founding teams are more likely to succeed than solo founders. Leveraging the power of a community and finding people with different areas of expertise can help address and overcome this apparent disadvantage. 

<h4><b><i> 4. Staying up-to-date </i></b></h4>

Community members who share the same interests can provide the latest details of what's happening in the industry. By finding out about changing trends in a proactive manner, you can differentiate yourself and improve your chances of success. 

<h4><b><i> 5. Receiving support </i></b></h4>

Surrounding yourself amongst people who know or understand what you are going through and who do not hesitate in speaking about it or reaching out, can be of tremendous help. This type of emotional support is also rather common in a community filled with like-minded individuals, who are in different stages of a similar, if not same, journey.
